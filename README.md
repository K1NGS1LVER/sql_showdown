Interactive Advanced SQL Quiz
This project is an interactive, web-based slideshow designed as a classroom activity for an advanced database course. It moves beyond basic CRUD operations to test understanding of more complex SQL concepts like window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), subqueries, and set operators.

The application presents a series of quiz questions, each with sample data tables. Students can attempt to solve the problems before the instructor reveals the correct MySQL query, the resulting output, and alternative solutions. This hands-on, engaging format helps reinforce theoretical knowledge and sparks discussion on query optimization and different problem-solving approaches in SQL.
